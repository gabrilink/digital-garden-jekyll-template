#### Excerpt from *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austen (Public Domain)

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.  

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"  

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.  

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."  

Mr. Bennet made no answer.  

"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.  

"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."  

This was invitation enough.  

(â€¦)

Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.  

(â€¦)

"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."  

(â€¦)

Elizabethâ€™s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed.  

(â€¦)

And so Darcy and Elizabeth were married, and their affection grew even stronger as they learned more of each other.
