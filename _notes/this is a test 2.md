#### Excerpt from *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville (Public Domain)

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—I set out to sea with a few dollars in my purse, a pint of bad whiskey, and a demented whale boat. I was restless and indifferent; I was often told that there was something odd about me, but I found solace in the chaos of the ocean.

Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. 

This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the sea. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me. 

(…)

I was soon provided with a ship, a magnificent whaling vessel called the Pequod. 

(…)

“There is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.” 

(…)

Thus began my journey, fraught with peril, adventure, and the unyielding pursuit of the great white whale.
