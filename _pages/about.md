<h1>About me</h1>

My name is **Gabriele Passuello**. I recently graduated with a [**Bachelor's Degree in Multimedia Science and Technology**](https://www.uniud.it/en/education/offer/courses/scientific-area/mathematics-computer-sciences-multimedia-physics/bachelor-degree-courses-undergraduate-180-ects/multimedia-science-and-technology) from the [*University of Udine*](https://www.uniud.it/en/), Italy. With a technical background in **computer science** and hands-on experience in *cybersecurity* and **Identity and Access Management**, I’ve built a strong foundation in *digital security*.  

I also spent a year studying abroad in *Barcelona*, an experience that broadened my perspective and strengthened my adaptability.  

Passionate about **video games**, **cinematography**, and **technology**, I have a particular interest in **computer graphics** and am always looking for opportunities to expand my skills in this field.

This site is inspired by [Steph Ango's website](https://stephango.com/) and built using a template from [Maxime Vaillancourt's guide](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).  

I’ve customized it to better suit my needs, making tweaks along the way.  

For editing and development, I rely on **VSCode**.
